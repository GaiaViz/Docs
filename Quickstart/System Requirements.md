# Hardware

memory: as big as the dataset you wish to work with
dedicated GPU (the bigger GPU, the bigger dataset can be loaded


# Software

Operating System: MS Windows 7, 10, 11
GaiaViz also needs some the following dll that sometime.
This dll is provided in the .zip folder.

System Requirements
1. Operating system: Windows 10+ 
2. RAM : 8Go available for
3. Disk space: sufficient for your dataset volume
## Requirements & prerequisites

Prerequisite:
- Navigation is pretty straight forward
- GaiaViz operators needs to be familiar with 3D tools and data wrangling process.

The minimum requirements for GaiaViz are:
